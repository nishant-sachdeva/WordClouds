Question for Act 1
It has been said of Shakespeare that Romans in his play are basically "Elizabethans in Togas". Do you agree? Comment for or against this statement and cite from Act 1
Question for Act 2
In this act, we see impactful exchanges between the two leading protagonists and their wives. In both cases, the wives claim a certain territory in the decision making of their husbands by virtue of them being partners in marriage and not mere harlots
Both of them are seen as protective and caring of their husbands and at the same time, not being mere pushovers.
How do you think these exchanges reflect the way Elizabethan society viewed women? Explain your view.
Note that Shakespeare lived under a queen monarch. So the ideas of women taking center stage were not entirely foreign to those people.
Question for Act 3
What do you mean by paralipsis and asyndeton? Describe how Mark Antony used these to influence the crowd post-Caesar's Assassination.
Also comment on the way these speeches show how Democracy (mal ?) functions.
Could the outcome of Julius Caesar been any different if the crowd's nature was different. Comment on the possibilities.
Question for Act 4
Quite a few one-to-one negotiations happen in this Act. At one stage, Cassius seems ready to strike at Brutus. Casca is an army general. Brutus an idealistic senator, old, is at risk.
However, Brutus turns the conversation around to the point that it is Casca himself who then changes his tone and appeals to the soft side of Brutus.
Describe the parley-ing tricks and methods of tact that Brutus then deploys to manipulate Casca to change his tone from one of offence to one of hurt and weilding.
Question for Act 5
Observe the final pre-war exchange between Cassius, Brutus, Octavius, and Antony. Observe also that Honor, as a concept, seems to be deeply rooted in the Roman gentry.
1. Both the groups seemed to think they are in the right and that their cause is more honorable
2. Both the groups, tried, through words, to smear the other party and to establish that they were not honorable
3. ( Hint: Reminds of the parliaments of today ) 
1. They seemed to care more about their "vision" of Rome rather than the actual people of Rome
2. ( Note that this was written in the Shakespearean era )
Through all this, the play also asks a question the English histories only hint at, and which it would have been treasonous to voice about Shakespeare's own queen: whether monarchs( or Autocrats) are even a good idea.
