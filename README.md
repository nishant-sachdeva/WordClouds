# WordClouds

Here , we write out code to generate a Frequency Based Word-Cloud . 

Running the code is fairly straightforward. Open the Jupyter Notebook and Run all the cells. In the end, you shall get the final wordCloud image for the text that has been used. 

* For changing the text for which you wanna generate the wordCloud, Please change the content of the file "test.txt" from the same directory. Else, you can change the upload path as well, if you're upto the task of modifying the code.
